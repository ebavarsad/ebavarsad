    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the power and simplicity of the **k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm by applying it to the classic **Iris flower dataset**. This dataset contains measurements of iris flowers' sepals and petals across three species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*), making it an ideal choice for supervised classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals are to:\n",
    "- Load and explore the dataset to understand its features and target classes.\n",
    "- Prepare the data by handling categorical labels and scaling features, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms like k-NN.\n",
    "- Implement the **k-NN classifier** from scratch using `scikit-learn`, tuning the `k` parameter to observe its impact on model performance.\n",
    "- Evaluate our model using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports to ensure robust performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "Our initial k-NN model, trained on the standardized Iris dataset with a chosen `k` value, produced strong classification metrics. The confusion matrix and classification report confirm that the model effectively distinguishes between the three iris species, with high precision, recall, and macro-averaged F1-scores across classes. These results highlight the strength of even a straightforward distance-based approach like k-NN when paired with appropriate preprocessing and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the value of `k` plays a crucial role in how well k-NN generalizes. A poorly chosen `k` could lead to overfitting or underfitting, directly impacting predictive performance. To ensure we have the most robust classifier possible, we’ll next explore optimizing `k` using the macro F1-score as our objective metric.\n"
