notebooks here run on python 3.7

all datasets are from kaggle

if you stumble across this and you are looking for a junior data analyst /
 data scientist or an astronomer, let me know :-D

7/2

dark matter heatmap notebook in milky way folder is nowhere near completion, 
will work on it after i get a few more data science notebooks in here.

the hippacros_star_astronomy_catalog depends on the zipped file 
isochrones_data.csv.zip which contains the ZAMS

current project ideas:
1. word classification
2. spectral classification with machine learning
3. bayesian refinement of expected radial velocities of stars using GAIA
4. smiling friends rpg (once i get the licensing)
5. variable star classification with machine learning
6. time series forecasting with ARIMA
