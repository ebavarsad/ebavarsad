I'm Ernest,

A data-focused problem solver with a strong background in physics, 
astronomy, statistics, and data science, I specialize in cleaning complex 
datasets, building machine learning models, and creating visualizations that 
can bring data to live and/or guide real-world decisions. My strength lies in 
bringing scientific precision and communication clarity to data-driven 
work.  I am also a well mannered and responsible person, as a single 
father currently working as a high school teacher, with much higher 
aspirations.

Currently..
A high school physics teacher
Adjunct Prof of Astronomy
Writer for OnOrbit Magazine

What I'm Looking For:

I'm actively seeking a junior data analyst or junior data scientist role.
I'm especially interested in opportunities in influencer marketing,   
scientific research support, product analytics, and engineering-driven 
organizations. My goal is to join a team where I can bring measurable
value through data insight and collaborative problem-solving in a positive,
and productive atmosphere.  I am willing to take a paycut for a year to prove 
my value and show my thanks :-)


What I Do:

- Data Analysis & Visualization: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, classification pipelines, 
logistic regression, Keras, Tensorflow, k-NN, multiclassification, 
RandomFTs, PyTorch, (theres more)
- Project Work: Forecasting, clustering, sentiment analysis, model 
evaluation, word classification
- Scientific Computing: Jupyter, IRAF, Astropy, GAIA data collection
- Communication & Teaching: Currently a high school physics teacher and a 
professor of astronomy at the College of Southern Nevada, so I have 
very strong presentation skills

Recent Projects:
- Variable Star Classifier
  Built a machine learning pipeline to classify variable stars using 
Hipparcos and Gaia data.
  Tools: Python, scikit-learn, data preprocessing, model tuning

- Twitter Sentiment Analysis
  Fine-tuned DistilBERT and TinyBERT models for sentiment classification.
  Tools: Hugging Face, Transformers, PyTorch

- Flight Price Forecaster
  Time series forecasting model using ARIMA with visualized confidence 
intervals.
  Tools: ARIMA (forecasting algorithm), statsmodels, pandas, matplotlib

- Titanic Classifier
  Built a full ML pipeline for survival prediction.
  Tools: CatBoost, scikit-learn, cross-validation

Currently Exploring:
- Bayesian modeling for astrophysical data
- Production-ready ML workflows
- Data storytelling with minimal code and clear outcomes
- Using ML for Health Science

I'm not just looking for a job â€” I'm looking for a team I can grow with by 
solving meaningful problems using data.  I'm looking to make the most out of 
my potential as a person and as a scientist.
